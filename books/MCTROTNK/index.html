<h3>Bye War!

  </h3>
<h5>
We returned to the kingdom and the war that was going on. We grabbed our swords and started to fight off the enemy team. They were in leather armor so we could cut through it pretty fast. Eventually they retreated from us because we were too good. We had James repair the security and repaired the portal back to how it was. We talked for a while about what we should do about the king in the other dimension. We decided that since we killed him he probably wouldn't mess with us. That's when I remembered it was spleef day. That meant the game would go on in the spleef world again. I hit the intercom button so i could get Elias and Bodie to come with me to the first game of the season. They came and we went through the spleef portal.

  <h3>
Another Painful Game!
      </h3>
  <h5>
We arrived at the stadium and immediately went to our seats. I had a special seat because I was the leader and I made special seats for my friends too including darksoul (who i learned his name is David) who ran against me I have now befriended. Dark-soul was a great player and was best with command-blocks just like James. There were 6 teams this time since the season just started. The 6 teams were: 1. Flaming Chickens 2. 39 Dimensions 3. Flying Chickens 4. Evil Commands 5. Team Epic  6. The Rise Of Darksoul. Team Epic led by this girl named Olivia who was one of my friends. Team Epic was my favorite team. It started out with Evil Commands against Flying Chickens. Since like last time we did a match i stuck to only my friends teams i'm just going to do that again. The first time Team Epic got to play was when they went against The Rise Of Dark Soul who was led by you guessed it dark-soul. Olivia charged at Dark-soul with her shovel and knocked him back and he fell into the water below. Jack who was on the Epic Team ran up to Bruh-Moment --who was dark-soul’s team mate-- and he hit him into the wall and Olivia hit him into the water. They high-fived and went back to the entrance where they entered the arena. When it was Epic Team’s next time to play a bunch of guys with red leather armor charged onto the arena and started attacking them. I told James to lock the portal and open the military portal and have them get here ASAP. The guys in red armor killed most of the spleef players who appeared at the city in their homes. The army arrived and ambushed the red-armored-players. I helped get rid of those pests as well after having my armor brought to me by one of the guards. We killed them off and returned to the city. 
</h5>
<h3>
  Explosions! Want some?
  </h3>
<h5>
The city was ruined. The whole place was all blown up and nothing was left. And worst of all they hacked into the server panel and installed a mod that keeps us from disabling hardcore. Hardcore Mode Enabled. Which means if we die we can't respawn. I saw this guy way up at the top of an obsidian tower he wore a red robe and a crown. It was the king we killed. He came back to get us. He jumped off the podium and charged straight at me. I grabbed my sword and attacked. I sliced his chest and he hit me with his glowy blue sword again I got hit with lightning and knocked backwards. I had James hand me the prototype Super-Sword he was making for me. I grasped the handle and jumped at him and cut his neck then got blasted back and died… I was gone forever. But luckily i managed to stop the server and disabled mod. When i started the server again i found myself dead and i… could… respawn. I grabbed my sword and charged towards the king and killed him. After re-enabling the mod. After I re-enabled the mod it was stuck. I couldn’t disable it. It was like someone was controlling the server. That's when I remembered the king added the mod. He has access to the server panel. I reset my password and removed access from everyone who had access to the server panel. I couldn’t believe I lost the whole city. I had to rebuild everything. I grabbed my blocks and everyone pitched in as we rebuilt the city but better.

<h3>
  Rebuilding
  </h3>

<h5>
The rebuilding started immediately and everyone helped out. This time we rebuilt everything in Portal Stone(not in vanilla Minecraft) which was as strong as obsidian but could change texture to look like any block. Portal Stone could also change shape to look like stairs, slabs, fences, etc. It took us hours to rebuild everything and when we were done the city was even better then it started. Luckily none of the buildings in the other dimensions were harmed. But we rebuilt everything in Portal Stone anyways.
    </h5>









































<h3>
The End
    </h3>
  <h5>
After rebuilding the city we announced to everyone that the king from the other dimension was killed and banned because hardcore is now on. Which means if you die you can't come back. I also let them know about a mod I added called “Real-Game-Essentials” which added a lot of stuff from the real world and a lot of cool made up things like Portal Stone. During the announcement I noticed some figures in black armor hiding in the crowd. I told the army to investigate. after I finished my speech I went and gave back the prototype sword back to James for him to work on. 5 army men charged through the door and told me that the Black-suited-figures were attacking citizens and I needed to help get rid of the immediately. I grabbed my sword and went out to the central of the city. there were only 5 men so we got through them quickly but that's when I was attacked from behind and knocked onto the ground. It was Darksoul! He attacked me. "What the heck?" I said "Its time!" he yelled just then about a hundred black suited figures came out and charged for me and my small army. I yelled for backup but no one came. it was over... I thought as I was killed and wiped from the server. the last thing I managed to say was "Why David!? Why!?".
