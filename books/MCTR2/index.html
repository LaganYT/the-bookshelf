<h3>The king is back!?


  </h3>

<h5>
	It was a normal day like any other. We were done fighting David when a portal appeared. It was the king who was ready for another fight. He jumped at me and attacked his army, poured through the portal and started fighting us. We called out one of our new robot-monsters that were stronger than the proto sword. I sliced the king’s arm off and punched him back into the portal. He came right back out and called in his army. He said he doesn’t want to fight anymore. He said that he wants to live with us. I thought it sounded fishy but I allowed it. He had his army build a second city which he and his army could live in. We have now officially merged with the king’s city. We have two times the army and citizens.

      <h3>The Beginning of the war


  </h3>

<h5>
Me and the king were talking when I got an alert from Makua. He said that he saw David coming for us when he was out getting more food for the city. We got ready our armies and were waiting for David at the gate when the king sent his army on ours. We fought him off. I attacked him but that's when I noticed David come up and attack too. It was chaos. There were 3 different armies fighting. We fought them off. We used the robot-monsters to help us fight. After we defeated the king we got ready to fight David when he said “WAIT!!” I was very confused. He announced “I'm you” . What did he mean? David said “No Logan I'm you”. I said “What do you mean?” he replied “I'm you but from another universe.” David said “I'm your opposite” I replied “So does that mean I was fighting myself the whole time?” he replied “Yes you were. We both were.” Ireplied “Well I guess then we should join together??” he replied “I guess.” “How did you figure it out?” I asked “Well when James created the portal it made a rift.” He said “The rift ended up cloning this universe and I was created. I was created and thought that you took over my castle so I tried to get it back.” So we joined forces and prepared for whatever was next.
