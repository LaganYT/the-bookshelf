<h3>The City

  </h3>
<h5>
Ever since we opened the server to the public we have had a lot more people join. Our city was finished before too many people joined so lucky everyone had a home. I decided that I wanted the city to be ruled by someone they voted for so I started an election. Me and this one guy named DarkSoul59 decided to run for president. DarkSoul was a nice guy and he was always helpful. The city we lived in was huge with a giant wall around it and guards everywhere. Our city was the only one on the server.

  <h3>
The Election
      </h3>
  <h5>
When it was time for me to read my speech I got on the podium and started right away.

“Hello everyone my name is Logan and i'm running for president today so we can have a safe city. I want to keep this server protected and fun for everyone.'' I got a lot of claps even though it was a very short speech. Next it was DarkSoul’s turn. The candidates weren’t allowed to hear each other's speeches so I have no idea what he said. When we were both done with our speeches everyone went into a room and pressed one of the two buttons one said vote for logan and the other said vote for DarkSoul. Neither of us knew who voted what but im pretty sure Bodie and elias voted for me. After everyone voted the scores came up on the board. And i won! I was the president of the city.
</h5>
<h3>
The Message
  </h3>
<h5>
Once i returned to the council room with Bodie and Elias we received a note from someone named Endie. We read the note and it said. That we may have defeated herobrine but now there king will rise and take over the world! The end is where the ender dragon lives and im pretty sure Endie is a enderman. So we went looking for ender pearls so we could save the end.</h5>



<h3>
Enderman  </h3>

<h5>
We started our journey looking for ender pearls by sleeping. After our nap we set off and immediately found an enderman who almost died fighting that beast. Lucky we didn't and got 1 pearl from it. We choose to look in our cave. We entered the cave and couldn’t find any right off the bat. After about 20 minutes we found about 5 enderman we killed them all and got 6 ender pearls and now we have a total of 7 ender pearls. We went back up to the surface and walked to the nearest forest and found a few more enderman and only 2 pearls. By then it was night but we kept looking and we went back to the cave and found 3 more pearls! We got them all! We headed back to base and went to bed.










































<h3>
The End
    </h3>
  <h5>
	It was time we headed for The End dimension to defeat the dragon. We looked for a strong hold so we could find the portal to the strange world. We went east as that is where the eye of ender told us to go. We traveled east for a while then we had to go north-east as the eye said. We finally arrived at the fortress at around dawn we dug down and entered the first room, the library. We went through the tunnels and passed many chambers until we reached the portal room. None of the eyes were in so we were lucky we made 12. We placed our eyes and waited for the void to return so we could jump in. when it appeared an enderman pulled us through the portal and the next thing you know it. We were trapped in a bedrock room. We did our best to get out. We tried using leftover over ender pearls to teleport out and believe it or not it worked. When we got out of the prison we saw that there was no dragon. We couldn’t believe it where did the dragon go!? A flash of light appeared above the exit portal and a giant enderman-like creature appeared and started charging straight for us. We grabbed our swords and sliced the creature as well as knocked it back. We grabbed our shields and blocked its other attack. We decided to knock it back and build a wall of obsidian to protect us. We got our swords and bows ready, jumped over the wall and shot the creature and knocked it into one of the obsidian pillars. It floated into the air and zoomed toward us and killed Bodie. I knew I didn't have time to watch my friend’s items fade away so I grabbed his arrows and shot the beast into the bedrock exit. I hit the creature with so much power it broke the bedrock when it made contact. The beast roared as it came charging straight for me. I ducked and hoped it would miss me. And it did it went right over my head and zoomed into the void killing itself. I knew I could do it. I felt so happy but I reacted too soon because a giant mutated enderman came from one of the pillars and charged straight for my wall. It broke instantly . I had to run and try not to die. When suddenly Bodie came straight from the prison jumped on an obsidian block and came dashing down and hit the beast. He killed that monster and free’d the end! We jumped through the portal and ended the game. </h5>
